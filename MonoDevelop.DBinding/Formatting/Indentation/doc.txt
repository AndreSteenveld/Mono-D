Module info:

DTextEditorIndentation.cs contains the binding between the Indent engine and MonoDevelop's Text Editor component.

DIndentationTracker.cs is an intermediate helper that creates indent strings (tabs, spaces) for specific locations inside a document.

DIndentEngine is the main engine that flies through the code roughly and puts/pops items on/off the indent stack for instance 
	after it has hit a { or } in the code.

IndentStack helps the IndentEngine to keep track of the indents that were required theoretically.
